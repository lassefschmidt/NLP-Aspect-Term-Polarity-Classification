### 1. Evaluation

Grading scheme:
- Accuracy on test set: 10pts
- Accuracy on dev set: 3pts
- Exec speed (training and inference): 4 pts
- README file: 3 pts

The first 3 scores are computed automatically with a python script.

Penalties will be applied for:
- Deliverable delays (-1 point per day)
- Group of more than 4: -5 pts per extra member, e.g. group of 6 => penalty = -5 x 2 = -10
- Exec error due to the use of a non-allowed python library: -5 pts
- Exec error due the use of a non compatible version of a library: -5 pts
- Exec error due to non compatible deliverable format (zip) or folder structure: -2 pts
- Other exec errors: penalty will depend on how much effort is required to correct the errors and make the program run successfully.

### 2. Contents of this Readme File
1. Names of the students who contributed to the deliverable (max=4)
2. A clear and detailed description of the implemented classifier (type of classification model, input and feature representation, resources etc.)
3. Accuracy on the dev dataset.
